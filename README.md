# web-notes
We are going to make a web app that stores notes we take in class. It will be able to list our notes and add new notes.  In the process, we'll learn about a very simple in-memory data store, server side templates, serving static files like css, request body formats, how to post data from a web page to a server and finally how to handle posted data on the server.
